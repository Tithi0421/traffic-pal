    <!--About Strings -->
    <string name="about">On this road to make Digital India, government has introduced many reforms. One of which was DigiLocker, that widely called out to the Computer Engineers of the nation and went on to become one of the most successful step towards this direction in 2016. One project that we would like to work on would run alongside this DigiLocker and that would serve the traffic police rather than the people. We would like to introduce an online system that would keep check of the road activities of the citizen through his license. Either introducing a QR code onto the License or using the DigiLocker to scan the code from the phone of the citizen, the police can instantly know the road activities of the person. This data will include the major road crimes, blacklisting, suspension of the license, and the like.
Introducing an android application for the above system would be the absolute path to meet the requirements. Used by over 80% of Indians, androidâ€™s dominance cannot be neglected.
We then have introduced another application for the users to check their license history. This system facilitates the user to know when and what violations he/ she has committed.
